1. Bubble Sort
--Iterates through the entire array
--Using an inner loop, whenever the current element is greater than next element, then both elements are swapped

2. Insertion Sort
--Iterates from second element to last element
--Current element is marked as the Key element
--Key is compared with previous elements and if it is smaller, then all elements are moved ahead and key is placed at correct position

3. Selection Sort
--Iterates through the entire array
--Minimum index is placed initially at the first element of the array
--Using an inner loop if any subsequent element is less then Minimum index element, then new minimum index is noted
--The lowest element is found in the inner loop array is swapped to current position
