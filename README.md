1. Bubble Sort
--Iterates through the entire array
--When ever the current element is greater than next element, then both elements are swapped

2. Insertion Sort
--Iterates from second element to last element
--Current element is marked as the Key element
--Key is compared with previous elements and if it is smaller, then all elements are moved ahead and key is placed at correct position
